## Default behavior
- `<a href="https://naver.com/">Go to NAVER</a>` Default behavior of anchor is to move to the page.
- As the first argument of `.addEventListener` function, we get an object that contains information about the event that just happened.
  - `link.addEventListener("click", handleLinkClick)`
  - `handleLinkClick({information about the event that just happened})`
  - e.g. clicked coordinates (x, y)
- We can prevent default behaviors by `.preventDefault()`
