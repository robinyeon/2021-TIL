## raw value
what programmers chose to write e.g. String, Int      
might make mistakes and JS do not let us know just showing error sign       
so instead of raw value we keep them in variables such as const     
then JS would specify which variable is wrong(in error)     

## `classlist`
`h1.classList.contain("className")`   
`h1.classList.remove("className")`    
`h1.classList.add("className")`
