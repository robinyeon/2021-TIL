Do not let my final destination to be set based on those social milestones.   
                                                 
Generic stereotypes and cultural expectations, the pressure from these surroundings produces unnecessary stress and negative thinking.    
                                                 
Be confident on my own destination. The important thing is to enjoy the experiences along the way.  
                                                 
"Success is over-hyped. Yes, it is powerful and rewarding. However, it is not there to rush you."
