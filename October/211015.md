### What makes a websites?       
Images, interactivity, texts, etc. Behind all that stuffs they are all the same.        
View(보기) > Developer(개발자 정보) > View Source(소스보기)      

### Our website is just a text file.          
If we write the correct texts in the correct space, we can make our own website.        
It's just a text file.        
-> if we print the text file, nobody's gonna understand it.     
-> But if we offer this to the browser, the browser looks and generates the page.     
-> The **Browser** is the one doing all the works.      
-> what we have to do, as developers, is what type of text we should write and where to put that texts.  

- To make websites: using min 2 ~ max 3 languages(let's not use the word 'text')    
- (1) HTML (2) CSS (3) JavaScript  

### HTML   
Contents: titles, images, links, descriptions, sidebars, etc.   
**THE BROWSER IS STUPID**       
they don't understand human language. So we have to tell browsers what is the contents.       
e.g. "Hey dude, this is the title, and this is sidebars." "Theres's a link behind the title."       
-> **We explain these contents' *structures* to browsers by HTML**    

### CSS
It should be used along with HTML. We never use HTML only or CSS only (seperately).    
- HTML: tells browsers what is the contents of your website. e.g. "That's the title."   
- CSS: tells browsers how does that contents look like. Visual things. e.g. "The title should be green."   

### JavaScript
```
HTML - bones
CSS - muscles
JavaScript - brain(to make sth shows up, for the interactivity)
```
Not every websites needs JavaScript.  

HTML: markup(content) language      
CSS: design/style language      
JavaScript: programming language      

### VSCode
Files/folders' name should be **lower case**    
VSCode is just a code(text) editor.       
Extension 'prettier': edit my mistakes automatically.     
  
### Browser
The browsers never tell if there's an error on the HTML file, they always try their best to show contents to users.

### Tag
**attributes**: adding extra information in tag
e.g.
```
<a href="http://google.com">Go to google.com</a>
<a href="http://google.com" target="_self">Go to google.com</a> 해당 창에서 열기
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Go to google.com</a> 새로운 창에서 열기
```
<img/> is a self-closing tag.
