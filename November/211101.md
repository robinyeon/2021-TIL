***Programming is not about memorizing method names or knowing all the possible methods. It's about being able to go back to lessons or documentation when you need to.***

### Reminder
- string```.startswith()```
- string```.endswith()```
- ```Number.parseInt(stringValueHere, 10)```
  - For example, if the user enters their age in a text box and they write: 35 (the number 35). When you read that value in JavaScript, you will receive it as a string. Thus, it will be "35" (a string containing 35).
  - Note that ```Number.parseInt``` is the name of the method. The word ```Number``` is not to be replaced.
  - The ```radix``` is the type of numbers that you're using. (humans use radix of 10, computers use binary which has a radix of 2) So the second argument will always be 10 (unless you're developing an application related to binary or other kinds of numerical systems).
