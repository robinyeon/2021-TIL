### The way of structuring HTML documents: Rules we must follow
1. ```<!DOCTYPE.html>``` letting know this is a html document not a text file or so.
2. then we should write ```<html></html>```
3. ```<head></head>``` configure **invisible** settings e.g. ```<title></title>``` for tab title
4. ```<body></body>``` where we put actual contents

<br/>

### ```<head></head>```
#### ```<meta>```
- meta tag shows extra data.
- self-closing tag
- contains attributes like: name, content, charset, property, etc.
- ```<meta charset="utf-8"/>``` tells browsers how to render text
- "og:title, description, og:image, etc." implement while sharing the website link e.g. ```<meta property="og:image"/>``` 
#### ```<link>```
- tab icons settings
#### ```<html lang="kr">```
This helps search engines know what is our main language in our website.

<br/>

### ```<label>```
activate pointed ```<input>```tag which shares same ```id``` with ```for```.
```
<label for="shouldBeSame">Profile Photo</label>
<input id="shouldBeSame" type="file" accept="image/*,.pdf"/> 
```

<br/>

### attribute ```id```
- ```id``` is an attribute that you can add any tags inside ```<body>```part.
- One id per one tag: **id must be unique**.
- The way how CSS can point out the exact elements.

<br/>

### Semantic tag
- 문서를 보기만 해도 그 의미를 짐작할 수 있는 것
- e.g. ```<div id="header"> === <header>```
- We should describe our document and contents as good as we can.
- Non-semantic tag means a tag that does not give any meaning. e.g. ```<span>```,```<p>```, etc.

<br/>

### VSCode tips
- ```cmd + d``` : change opening tag and closing tag at the same time.
- ```alt```: change the selected areas at the same time.

<br/>

***Don't need to remember all attributes, just indicate they exist and search from MDN or so on, instead.***
