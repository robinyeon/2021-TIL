position
position: fixed e.g. chatting btn
initial position is the position where it was.
but the moment we put properties top, bottom, left, right

position: static(default)

position: relative 
(e.g. wanna move small box div inside div)
then top left=-10px, etc.
element가 처음 위치한 곳을 기준으로 수정. 처음 위치를 가져다가 그 점을 기준으로 옮기는것. based on where it starts
from the place where element starts to the top, left, ... (starting position)  

position: absolute
absolute is looking for a relative parents. closest relative parents tag.
could not find relative father, body

relative & absolute impo. 슬백생 지도 적용이론

3.14
pseudo selectors
```
div:last-child {
}
```
much better than making more ids or classes
first-child, last-child, nth-child(2), nth-child(even) = nth-child(2n),
nth-child(n+1) whateva we want
