## `Number()`, `parseInt()`
```
let num = Number("1000won"); // NaN
let num = parseInt("1000won"); // 1000
let num = parseInt("won1000"); // NaN
```
- `parseInt()` 역시 시작이 숫자가 아니면 `Number()`와 마찬가지로 num에 `NaN` 저장

## 백준 15552 빠른 A+B_JS
```
// 빠른 A+B

let input = require("fs").readFileSync("/dev/stdin").toString().trim().split("\n");

let answer = "";

for (let i = 1; i <= Number(input[0]); i++) {
    let numbers = input[i].split(" ");
    answer += Number(numbers[0]) + Number(numbers[1]) + "\n"
};
console.log(answer)
```
- **매번 `console.log` 출력 시 시간초과가 되니, 하나의 문자열에 A+B와 개행문자를 저장하여 마지막에 한 번 출력함**

<br/>

## `.repeat()`
- Returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
```
const chorus = 'Because I\'m happy. ';

console.log(`Chorus lyrics for "Happy": ${chorus.repeat(27)}`);

// expected output: "Chorus lyrics for "Happy": Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy. "
```
- 백준 별찍기 문제 풀때 유용

## Optional chaining `?.`
- optional chaining allows us to have `undefined` instead of an error.

<br/>

## Nullish coalescing `??`
- Nullish coalescing allows us to default to a certain value when th left-hand side is a nullish value(`null` or `undefined`).

<br/>

## null vs undefined
- `undefined` means that the value has not been defined yet.
- Whereas, `null` means that the value has been defined but is empty.
- In most scenarios, this distinction does not matter.
```
const user = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Sam",
    age: null
}

console.log(user.age); // null
console.log(user.birthday); // undefined
```
- We used `null` here to mean that the `age` property has been defined, but does not have a value yet.
- The `birthday` property has not been defined yet, which is why it returns `undefined`.
- Remember though, that the need to have this distinction is not very common.

## Implicit conversion & [falsy values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) 
- The `if` statement expects a boolean. However, when you provide it with a value of another type, it will automatically convert it to a boolean. This is called implicit conversion because the conversion is occurring automatically.
- In JavaScript, the values below will be converted to `false` and everything else will be converted to `true`:
  - false (is already a boolean)
  - null
  - undefined
  - 0
  - NaN
  - "" (empty string)
